I have the privilege (and responsability!) to supervise a group of brilliant trainees.

Here is a list of people working in my group.

# PhD
### [Melanie Tschiersch (co-supervised with Albert Compte)](https://braincircuitsbehavior.org/people-posts/melanie-tschiersch-hj27a)
_Melanie is an engineer and she will graduate soon. She has been working on data-analysis and modeling of working memory, in particular how the two prefrontal cortices interact with each other during working memory tasks. Monkey data comes form [Matthew Smith lab](https://www.cmu.edu/bme/People/Faculty/profile/msmith.html)._
### [Lubna Abdul](https://projects.learningplanetinstitute.org/projects/a-cross-species-approach-to-investigate-altern/summary)
_Lubna, in the first year of her PhD thesis, studied Physics and Science Communciation. She is analysing and modelling behavioral and neural data collected from monkeys and humans, including patients, while they perform context-dependent decision making tasks. She collects human data. Monkey data comes form [Earl Miller lab](https://ekmillerlab.mit.edu/earl-miller/)._
# Research Engineers
### [Kaleab Belay (co-supervised with Nikolas Karalis)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=p5XB7SYAAAAJ&hl=en)
_Kaleab studied Computer Science and Machine learning. He is working in data-driven RNN models of neuromodulators. Data comes from [Nikolas Karalis lab](https://www.neuronaldynamics.eu/team/nikolas)._
### [Philipp Werthmann](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Philipp-Werthmann)
_Philipp studied Physics and Neuroscience. He is working in data-driven RNN models of multi-regional recordings. Data comes form [Earl Miller lab](https://ekmillerlab.mit.edu/earl-miller/)._
# Master

### [Clara Hornung]
### [Arghavan Aslani](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=G9CAbhIAAAAJ&hl=en)
# Alumni

### [Laurine Marty (Master student)](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/laurine-marty)
<!-- :_Laurine studies Computer Science and Cognitive Neuroscience. Her thesis was about foundation models, specificaly transformers, of neuroimaging data. Data was form [Michael Pereira](https://neurosciences.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/en/michael-pereira) lab._  -->

She is now doing a PhD with Guillaume Bellec.

### [Ibrîze Bonneville (Master student)](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/ibr%C3%AEze-bonneville-993a37217)
<!-- _Ibrîze studied Math, Life Sciences and Biomedical Engineering. In her thesis, she used data-driven RNN to model behaivoral data.  Data was form [Gouki Okazawa]([https://neurosciences.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/en/michael-pereira](https://www.g-okazawa-lab.net/)) lab._-->
### Romain Hû (Master student)
<!--_Romain studied Medicine and Math. He was doing is Master in Math and AI. He got first-hand experience with analysing and modeling single-unit recordings from human patients during working memory tasks. Data came from [Jan Kaminski lab](https://www.jankaminski.com/news)._-->
