I have the privilege (and responsability!) to supervise a group of brilliant trainees.

Here is a list of people working in my group.

PhD
=====
## [Melanie Tschiersch (co-supervised with Albert Compte)](https://braincircuitsbehavior.org/people-posts/melanie-tschiersch-hj27a)

Melanie, who will graduate soon, has been working on data-analysis and modeling of working memory, in particular how the two prefrontal cortices interact with each other. Monkey data comes form Matthew Smith lab.

## [Lubna Abdul](https://projects.learningplanetinstitute.org/projects/a-cross-species-approach-to-investigate-altern/summary)

Lubna, in the first year of her PhD thesis, is analysing and modelling behavioral and neural data collected from monkeys and humans, including patients, while they perform context-dependent decision making tasks. She collects human data. Monkey data comes form Earl Miller lab.

Research Engineers
=====
## [Kaleab Belay (co-supervised with Nikolas Karalis](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=p5XB7SYAAAAJ&hl=en)

Kaleab is working in data-driven RNN models of neuromodulators. Data comes from Nikolas Karalis lab.

### [Philipp Werthmann](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Philipp-Werthmann)

Philipp is working in data-driven RNN models of multi-regional recordings. Data comes form Earl Miller lab.

Master
=====
## [Laurine Marty (second year)](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/laurine-marty)

Laurine thesis is about foundation models, specificaly transformers, of neuroimaging data. Data comes form Michael Pereira lab.

## [Ibrîze Bonneville (second year)](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/ibr%C3%AEze-bonneville-993a37217)

Ibrîze thesis is about using data-driven RNN to model of behaivoral data that she collects online.

## Jeanne Sentenac (second year, co-supervised with Srdjan Ostojic)

Jeanne Thesis is about theoretical models of working memory manipulation.

## Romain Hû (first year)

Romain is getting first-hand experience with analysing and modeling single-unit recordings from human patients during working memory tasks. Data comes from Jan Kaminski lab.
