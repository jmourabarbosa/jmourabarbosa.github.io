I have the privilege (and responsability!) to supervise a group of brilliant trainees.

Here is a list of people working in my group.

# PhD
### [Melanie Tschiersch (co-supervised with Albert Compte)](https://braincircuitsbehavior.org/people-posts/melanie-tschiersch-hj27a)
_Melanie is an engineer and she will graduate soon. She has been working on data-analysis and modeling of working memory, in particular how the two prefrontal cortices interact with each other during working memory tasks. Monkey data comes form [Matthew Smith lab](https://www.cmu.edu/bme/People/Faculty/profile/msmith.html)._
### [Lubna Abdul](https://projects.learningplanetinstitute.org/projects/a-cross-species-approach-to-investigate-altern/summary)
_Lubna, in the first year of her PhD thesis, studied Physics and Science Communciation. She is analysing and modelling behavioral and neural data collected from monkeys and humans, including patients, while they perform context-dependent decision making tasks. She collects human data. Monkey data comes form [Earl Miller lab](https://ekmillerlab.mit.edu/earl-miller/)._
# Research Engineers
### [Kaleab Belay (co-supervised with Nikolas Karalis)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=p5XB7SYAAAAJ&hl=en)
_Kaleab studied Computer Science and Machine learning. He is working in data-driven RNN models of neuromodulators. Data comes from [Nikolas Karalis lab](https://www.neuronaldynamics.eu/team/nikolas)._
### [Philipp Werthmann](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Philipp-Werthmann)
_Philipp studied Physics and Neuroscience. He is working in data-driven RNN models of multi-regional recordings. Data comes form [Earl Miller lab](https://ekmillerlab.mit.edu/earl-miller/)._
# Master
### [Laurine Marty (second year)](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/laurine-marty)
_Laurine studies Computer Science and Cognitive Neuroscience. Her thesis is about foundation models, specificaly transformers, of neuroimaging data. Data comes form [Michael Pereira](https://neurosciences.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/en/michael-pereira) lab._
### [Ibrîze Bonneville (second year)](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/ibr%C3%AEze-bonneville-993a37217)
_Ibrîze studied Math, Life Sciences and Biomedical Engineering. In her thesis, she uses data-driven RNN to model behaivoral data that she collects online._
### Romain Hû (first year)
_Romain studied Medicine and Math. He is doing is Master in Math and AI. He is getting first-hand experience with analysing and modeling single-unit recordings from human patients during working memory tasks. Data comes from [Jan Kaminski lab](https://www.jankaminski.com/news)._
