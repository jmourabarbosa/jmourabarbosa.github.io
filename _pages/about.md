I am a computational neuroscientist with a strong interest in human cognition, particularly focusing on working memory and decision-making and how these functions are affected in pathological conditions.  

My research approach reflects the breadth of my academic background, which spans computer science, biology and machine learning. In my research I develop statistical methods to analyze large scale recordings, using biophysical and deep learning models to guide these analyses and the design of novel human experiments.  

My current research goal is to help unveil which across-region interactions along the brain hierarchy support cognitive flexibility and whether their disruption is the basis for cognitive inflexibility of clinical populations, such as schizophrenia.
