Meaningless bio
======

I started studying Civil Engineering but quickly realized I didn't want to spent my life building bridges, so I switched to Computer Science. I had a lot of fun during the first years with Calculus, Algebra, Logic and all the sciency part of computers; not as much towards the end. You know, with software enginering and all the sort of things that pay well. After graduating, I switched fields again, now to Bioinformatics. Then, my favourite courses were Neurobiology and Machine Learning which might have influenced the choice of my PhD topic.

Before enrolling in a PhD program in Barcelona, I traveled within Central America for a year, where I developed a passion for street photography. Please take a look at some of my pictures at my [Street Photography](https://fuji360.tumblr.com/archive) corner. 

During my 6-year long PhD in Albert Compte’s lab I spent most of my time in rooftop barbecues organised by Genis. In my free time, I focused on the possible neural mechanisms of working memory. Because I am now a postdoc, I don't have much free time anymore, so I hope I can finally focus full time on Genis' barbecues.
