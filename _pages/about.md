I am a computational neuroscientist with a strong interest in human cognition, in particular working memory and decision-making and how these are affected in pathological conditions.  

My research approach reflects the breadth of my academic background, which spans computer science, biology and machine learning. In my research, I use biophysical and deep learning models to guide the analyses of large scale recordings, as well as the design of novel experiments in humans.  

My current research goal is to help unveil the cross-region interactions within the primate brain that support cognitive flexibility, and to determine whether their disruption underlies the cognitive inflexibility observed in clinical populations, such as those with schizophrenia. This research will be conducted at the newly established Institute for Neuromodulation (INM), which was created through a close collaboration between Sainte-Anne Hospital and Neurospin, in Paris.

At INM, we record and manipulate the human brain at all scales with non invasive methods (ultra high field MRI, M/EEG), invasive electrophysiology (sEEG, tracking of monoamine release with voltammetry) as well as casual interventions (deep brain stimulation, pharmacology, vagus nerve stimulation, focused ultrasound stimulation and TMS).
