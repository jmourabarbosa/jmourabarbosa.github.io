I am a computational neuroscientist with a strong interest in human cognition, particularly focusing on working memory and context-dependent decision-making and how these are affected in normal and pathological conditions.  

My research approach reflects the breadth of my academic background, which spans computer science, biology and machine learning. In my research, I apply and developed statistical methods to analyze large scale recordings and use biophysical and deep learning models to guide the analyses and design of human experiments.  

My long term research goal is to unveil which across-area interactions along the brain hierarchy support cognitive flexibility and whether their disruption is the basis for cognitive flexibility impairments in clinical populations, such as schizophrenia.  1
