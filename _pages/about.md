  <h2>Current Position</h2>
  <p>Since 2025, I have been a Principal Investigator (INSERM) at the Institut de Neuromodulation and NeuroSpin, Paris, where I lead a research group focused on computational neuroscience and machine learning approaches to understanding brain function.</p>

  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>I completed my PhD in Computational Neuroscience at the Universidad de Barcelona, where I worked on understanding the neural mechanisms of working memory and decision-making. During my doctoral studies, I had the opportunity to visit Princeton University to work with the Buschman lab, which broadened my perspective on cognitive neuroscience.</p>

  <p>After completing my PhD, I worked as a postdoc at IDIBAPS with the Compte lab, and later at the Ecole Normale Superieure in Paris with the Ostojic lab. I also spent time as a visiting researcher at the Flatiron Institute's Center for Computational Neuroscience.</p>

  <h2>Research Philosophy</h2>
  <p>I believe that understanding the brain requires a combination of theoretical frameworks, computational modeling, and close collaboration with experimentalists. My work bridges multiple scales and approaches, from single neurons to large-scale brain networks, always with the goal of understanding how neural computations support complex behavior.</p>

  <h2>About the Neuromodulation Institute</h2>
  <p>At INM, we record and manipulate the human brain at all scales with non invasive methods (ultra high field MRI, M/EEG), invasive electrophysiology (sEEG, tracking of monoamine release with voltammetry) as well as casual interventions (deep brain stimulation, pharmacology, vagus nerve stimulation, focused ultrasound stimulation and TMS).</p>
