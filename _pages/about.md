I started studying Computer Science in Portugal, my homeland. However, I finished my undergraduate degree in Amsterdam and never came back home. During my master in Bioinformatics in Bologna, my favourite courses were Neurobiology and Machine Learning which might have influenced the choice of my PhD topic. Before enrolling in a PhD program in Barcelona, I traveled within Central America for a year, where I developed a passion for street photography. Check some of my pictures at fuji360.tumblr.com. During my 6-year long PhD in Albert Compteâ€™s lab I spent most of my time in rooftop barbecues organised by Genis. In my free time, I focused on the possible neural mechanisms of working memory. Because I am now a postdoc, I don't have much free time anymore, so I hope I can finally focus full time on Genis' barbecues.
