## The neural mechanisms of working memory

During my PhD I mostly focus the plausible neural mechanisms for working memory [Barbosa. Journal of Neuroscience (2017)](https://jmourabarbosa.github.io/files/Barbosa2017.pdf) and in particular whether working memory is supported by activity-silent mechanisms [Barbosa et al (2021)](https://psyarxiv.com/qv6fu/), such as short-term plasticity. Through a combination of human and monkey neurophysiological experiments, data analysis and computational models, we unveiled the neurophysiological basis of the interference of previous, irrelevant memories on currently maintained memories - the so-called serial dependence [Barbosa et al Nature Neuroscience (2020)](https://jmourabarbosa.github.io/publications/). We found that a tight interaction between persistent neuronal firing and short-term plasticity in the prefrontal cortex supports working memory and is expressed behaviorally in serial dependence, both in monkeys and human subjects. 


## Synaptic basis of reduced serial dependence in patients with schizophrenia

We found that serial dependence is dramatically reduced in schizophrenia and anti-NMDAR encephalitis patients [Stein\*, Barbosa\* et al Nature Communications (2020)](https://jmourabarbosa.github.io/publications/) and decreases progressively throughout healthy aging [unpublished]; others have shown a similar reduction of serial dependence for patients with autism [Lieder et al Nature Neuroscience (2019)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0308-9?WT.feed_name=subjects_cognitive-neuroscience). When we incorporated our monkey and human neurophysiological findings in a biophysically-constrained computational model of working memory, it allowed us to quantitatively explain serial dependence disruption in all of the aforementioned populations on the basis of disrupted short-term plasticity mechanisms. 

By associating these diseases with short-term plasticity, our work is opening new lines of research to understand their mechanistic basis [Stein\*, Barbosa\* et al 2021](https://psyarxiv.com/uxg2a).

## Within- and across-area neural dynamics involved in complex behavior

*Across-area synchronized dynamics support the integration of independently stored features in multi-item working memory*. We built a biophysical neural network model composed of two one-dimensional attractor networks, one for color and another one for location, simulating the storage of  each feature in a different cortical area [Barbosa et al CCCN 2019](https://bit.ly/32FicoJ). Within each area, gamma oscillations were induced during bump attractor activity through the interplay of fast recurrent excitation and slower feedback inhibition. As a result, different memorized items were held at different phases of the network’s intrinsic oscillation. These two areas were then reciprocally connected via weak cortico-cortical excitation, accomplishing binding between color and location through the synchronization of pairs of bumps across the two connected areas. Encoding and decoding of specific color-location associations was accomplished through rate coding, overcoming a long-standing limitation of binding through temporal coding. In some simulations, swap errors arose: “color bumps” abruptly changed their phase relationship with “location bumps”. This model, which keeps the explanatory power that is characteristic of similar attractor models, specifies a plausible mechanism for feature binding and makes specific predictions about swap errors that are testable at behavioral and neurophysiological levels.
