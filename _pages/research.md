## The neural mechanism of working memory

Through a combination of human and monkey neurophysiological experiments, data analysis and computational models, we unveiled the neurophysiological basis of the interference of previous, irrelevant memories on currently maintained memories - the so-called serial dependence [Barbosa, Stein et al Nature Neuroscience (2020)]. Specifically, we found that a tight interaction between persistent neuronal firing and short-term plasticity in the prefrontal cortex supports working memory and is expressed behaviorally in serial dependence, both in monkeys and human subjects. Moreover, we found that serial dependence is dramatically reduced in schizophrenia and anti-NMDAR encephalitis patients [Stein, Barbosa et al Nature Communications (2020)] and decreases progressively throughout healthy aging [unpublished]; others have shown a similar reduction of serial dependence for patients with autism [Lieder et al Nature Neuroscience (2019)]. When we incorporated our neurophysiological findings in a biophysically-constrained computational model of working memory, it allowed us to quantitatively explain serial dependence disruption in all of the aforementioned populations on the basis of disrupted short-term plasticity mechanisms. 

By associating these diseases with short-term plasticity, our work is opening new lines of research to understand their mechanistic basis.
