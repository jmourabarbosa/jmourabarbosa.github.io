Research on the neural basis of working memory
Motivation
Working memory (WM) is a core function of cognition. This is reflected in the strong correlation between WM performance and other cognitive abilities, notably IQ1. Importantly, WM is impaired in major neurological dysfunctions, including schizophrenia2. Sustained activity in prefrontal cortex neurons has been regarded as the neural substrate of working memory, but this has been under intense debate in recent years3. Alternative proposals suggest that short-term synaptic plasticity also plays a role in supporting working memory. 

Summary of findings
In my graduate research, I contributed substantially to this debate by showing that both mechanisms co-exist and interact in the monkey PFC. Moreover, I bridged some insights from biophysical modeling and monkey research directly to experiments with clinical populations (i.e. people with schizophrenia (PSZ) and anti-NMDAR encephalitis)

Approach 
I combined biophysical modeling4â€“8 and data analysis of spiking activity from the monkey PFC5, human EEG5,8, and TMS 5, to tackle open questions in working memory research. Data analysis, computational modeling, and human experiments were performed by me, with the exception of the design of EEG experiments and their data collection, which were done in our lab through direct collaboration. Monkey electrophysiological recordings were outsourced through a collaboration with Wake Forest University, USA.
